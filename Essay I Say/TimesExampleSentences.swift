My mother lets me go out with my friends
I prefer my coffee black
She puts the keys on the table
The teacher shouts at us all the time
I have two brothers
Coffee grows in Brazil
She can eat those vegitables
They cannot know how

She is listening the music now
We are learning English at this moment
My mother is cooking dinner in the kitchen now
The gardener is working in the garden at this time
At present, children are doing a lot of things that can not be done before
She is having breakfast at the moment
Look! A car is coming


I have already prepared breakfast
My sister has cleaned the room
It has rained a lot lately
I have seen her before
She has watched this movie several times
He has saved $20000000 up until now
They have gone fishing until later this evening
I have solved 20 questions so far

let past = """
We watched the news last night
They went to the party yesterday
She read the book
He drew beautiful pictures last week
I learnt Spanish last summer
You gave the present to your friend
We bought a new car
The paperclips did not burn in the fire
Trees did not burn
An apple did not fall off the table
His children did eat the remaining pieces
The company did avoid paying their taxes

You were watching television last night
They were studying math yesterday
I was washing the dishes when the phone rang
As she was reading the book, Alice came
The students were drawing beautiful pictures when the teacher entered the classroom
It was raining yesterday evening
I was learning German last year
I was crying while he was laughing
He was working when I called him

If you had studied hard last year, he would have passed all his exams
She had done her homework so she was happy
He had lived in Florida for ten years before he moved to California
They had gone out when you called
The woman had cried till the morning
I had returned to university
He had left when I went to the club
By the time we came, she had finished the project

They had been being friend since childhood
Thomas had been trying to repair the phone the whole day
We had been studying all day so we tired
Helen had been listening the same music for 4 hours when I came back home
Daniel had been watching TV for hours before he slept
You had been walking all afternoon on the beach

let future =
    """
He will play basketball
I will meet with him
I will call him as soon as possible
We will overcome the problems
We will live the house
He will try to contact us next week
They will study math
She will be here soon

I will be waiting for you
It will be raining at this time tomorrow
He will be visiting his friends this time next week
She will be watching TV
This time tomorrow, we will be working on our project
They will be writing letter to each other

They won’t have been maried by next year
By that time I will have finished my homework
They’ll have relaxed by night
When my father comes home, my mother will have read me a story
Susan will have been ready by the time I get home
The plane will have landed by that time

At 4 o’clock, we will have been waiting you for one hour
She will have been sleeping at home for two hours when we arrives
He will have been playing the guitar for ten years when he turn twenty
They will have been teaching German for 5 years by the end of this year
I will have been travelling to Japan by this time next week
When I am at school, my family will have been flying to New York
I will have been working for seven hours by the time the boss comes
She will have been sleeping for one hour when he gets home
I will have been playing tennis tomorrow afternoon
We won’t have been working for a long time until you come back
How long will you have been studying when you graduate
I will have been living in İstanbul for 10 years by 2025
He will have been watching tv for 2 hours when we have dinner
