He will play basketball
I will meet with him
I will call him as soon as possible
We will overcome the problems
We will live the house
He will try to contact us next week
They will study math
She will be here soon
The dinner won't be ready soon
It won't be his fault
There will not be any leftovers
They won't be long
The house will not be sold
The team will not play on Saturday
Redhawks will not repopulate Saturn
Saturn won't convince rainbows about their strategies
Drawers will not be filled by me or them
Her aprons won't be worn
Deciding her fate won't be easy
Creating a solution will not require much work
Flying to mars won't be as hard as they all say
Eating meat will not make your body more flexible
She won't summerize her paper
The villagers will not eat anymore
Pipeline will close to avoid any accidents

We watched the news last night
They went to the party yesterday
She read the book
He drew beautiful pictures last week
I learnt Spanish last summer
You gave the present to your friend
We bought a new car
The paperclips did not burn in the fire
Trees did not burn
An apple did not fall off the table
His children did eat the remaining pieces
The company did avoid paying their taxes
She didn't try hard enough
He did not even try to help
They didn't want the new car
It did not get one inch off the ground
The wheels didn't slip at all
How far did you say it flew
Which element did you find
Who did you meet yesterday
What time did he arrive
Where did the crocodiles go
When the Egyptians vanished who took their place
The challenges grew each day
Every one of them knew their limits
Did all ears point to the same broadcast
Such delicacy was hardly ever found
When did it happen
What and how was it
Did she discover it
Did the roadway up the mountain get built by gnomes or giants
How many UFOs did the government know about
He ate earlier
They didn't clean the house
The carpet did not get vacuumed
I did
You did
She did
He did
They did

My mother lets me go out with my friends
I prefer my coffee black
She puts the keys on the table
The teacher shouts at us all the time
I have two brothers
Coffee grows in Brazil
She can eat those vegitables
They cannot know how
They must wear their helmets
Kids often know best
I always forget to turn off the lights
You never eat the broccoli
She always gets the best bit
Palm trees grow in warm climates
Illness do spread like wildfire
Chicago does have a racial divide
Quarterpounders are less than a quarterpound
Telepathy is a real thing
George Carlin does not die
I am
It is what it is
He is
She is
They are
We are
You are 
I do
It does indicate something
He does go sometimes
She does tweet far too often
They do warship their Great God
We do cherish each other
You do have my number
I am not hungry nor thirsty
It is not the vehicle making that noise
He is not that generous
She is not givng up on her Lord
They are not planting the seeds properly
You are not as impotant as they say you are
I do not reckon i could tell you
It does not mean anything useful
He does not have his head in the clouse
She does not foresee a terrible future
They do not have any clue how to make a fire
We do not fly our planes like you do
You do not
I can frame the picture for you
You can hardly understand how happy i am
It can challenge even the best of us
He can easily see a way into the cave
She can hear what i say
They can and would love to join
We can all see other beings
I cannot
You cannot shy away from your fears
She cannot
He cannot
The child cannot
I must eat the food my mother cooks me
He must
You must
It must not be the right time to go
They must not have the time

I will be waiting for you
It will be raining at this time tomorrow
He will be visiting his friends this time next week
She will be watching TV
This time tomorrow we will be working on our project
They will be writing letter to each other

You were watching television last night
They were studying math yesterday
I was washing the dishes when the phone rang
As she was reading the book Alice came
The students were drawing beautiful pictures when the teacher entered the classroom
It was raining yesterday evening
I was learning German last year
I was crying while he was laughing
He was working when I called him

She is listening the music now
We are learning English at this moment
My mother is cooking dinner in the kitchen now
The gardener is working in the garden at this time
At present, children are doing a lot of things that can not be done before
She is having breakfast at the moment
A car is coming

They won’t have been maried by next year
By that time I will have finished my homework
They’ll have relaxed by night
When my father comes home, my mother will have read me a story
Susan will have been ready by the time I get home
The plane will have landed by that time

If you had studied hard last year, he would have passed all his exams
She had done her homework so she was happy
He had lived in Florida for ten years before he moved to California
They had gone out when you called
The woman had cried till the morning
I had returned to university
He had left when I went to the club
By the time we came, she had finished the project

I have already prepared breakfast
My sister has cleaned the room
It has rained a lot lately
I have seen her before
She has watched this movie several times
He has saved $20000000 up until now
They have gone fishing until later this evening
I have solved 20 questions so far
My mother has cooked the dinner
We have received many mail since we were retired

We won’t have been working for a long time until you come back
How long will you have been studying when you graduate
I will have been living in İstanbul for 10 years by 2025
He will have been watching tv for 2 hours when we have dinner

They had been being friends since childhood
Thomas had been trying to repair the phone the whole day
We had been studying all day so we tired
Helen had been listening to the same music for 4 hours when I came back home
Daniel had been watching TV for hours before he slept
You had been walking all afternoon on the beach
